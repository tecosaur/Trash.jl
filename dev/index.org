#+title: Trash

Sometimes you want to get rid of a file, but make it possible for it to be
restored later (by your program or the user).

The way this should be done varies by operating system. This library helps you
handle this simply and in a (largely, see /Platform Complications/) cross-platform
way with [[@ref][~trash~]]. It's no surprise that the utility of this function has been
realised across [[https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash][multiple]] [[https://github.com/arsenetar/send2trash][language]] [[https://github.com/Byron/trash-rs][ecosystems]], with a healthy collection of
cross-platform trash libraries floating around. Most of these only provide the
ability to send a file to the trash, but Trash.jl goes further, giving you the
ability to restore items with [[@ref][~untrash~]], inspect the contents of the trash with
[[@ref][~list~]], and delete the trash with [[@ref][~empty~]].
