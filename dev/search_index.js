This library helps you handle this simply and in a (largely, see Platform Complications) cross-platform way with trash. It's no surprise that the utility of this function has been realised across multiple language ecosystems, with a healthy collection of cross-platform trash libraries floating around. Most of these only provide the ability to send a file to the trash, but Trash.jl goes further, giving you the ability to restore items with untrash, inspect the contents of the trash with list, and delete the trash with empty.","category":"page"}]
