A cross-platform library for safe, recoverable file deletion. Move files and
directories to your system's trash rather than deleting them outright, and
manage trashed items programmatically --- all with one uniform API.

See the docs (and docstrings) for a detailed overview, but you can also just get
started by using ~trash~ instead of ~rm~.

Most trashing libraries (particularly cross-platform ones) stop at sending
things to the trash; this library lets you inspect and retrieve items from the
trash with ~Trash.list~ and ~untrash~. Finally, you can invoke ~Trash.empty~ to make
deletion a bit more permanent.
